## Project Overview
This project is a simple web application that calculates the **day of the week** a user was born and assigns them an **Akan name** based on their gender. 
Akan names are a Ghanaian cultural tradition where children are named after the day of the week on which they were born.
The site takes a userâ€™s **birthdate** and **gender** (input by the user), calculates the weekday, and displays the correct Akan name
